			Tap Tempo
		</h3>
		<p align="justify">
			Qrest can help you find the tempo of a tune.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">
		    	All you need to do is click the "TAP" button in sync with your tune's beats, and Qrest will give you the BPM and calculate new vaules in realtime.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">
			On the very first clicks you'll notice a red light showing besides the "TAP" button. This is the steadiness indicator. It will turn green when Qrest detects that you are tapping steadily.
