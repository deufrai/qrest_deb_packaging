QREST

A musician toolkit aimed at helping composers, performers, recordists and mixers :

- finding out the tempo of a musical piece
- calculate delay times for common notes, according to tempo
- calculate LFO frequencies for common notes, according to tempo

Qrest is a standalone desktop application running on GNU/linux, Windows and Mac OSX

Code is C++ and relies on the Qt framework for GUI

All non-GUI code is Qt-free, with the only exception of the timer used for TAPTEMPO feature. (We would most gladly welcome a portable FIXME for this one)
